### Control of expenses

We need to develop a website that helps us to manage our income and expenses, in order to know how much money we have saved.

## Essential requirements
1. The application must show at all times the total expenses, income and the total money we have saved.
1. We will be able to add an income or an expense by including a concept.
1. We will be able to delete any expense or income that we have entered.

## Optional requirements
1. If we close the website and log in again, we have to retrieve all the expenses and income we have entered, as well as the total savings.
